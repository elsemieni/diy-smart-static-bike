# A DIY Smart bike project
### Just a note:

This is a WIP project, and if it's status is functional, it's well behavior is not warranted. It depends of my free time and things life throws me if this project gets updated or not. (Hope it will be, sounds like fun!). Also, if you have comments, suggestions or PR, all of these are very welcomed!

# About:

As the name says, this is a project about a cheap alternative to play with static bikes with no needing of expensive services and/or pro gear spec. 

More than a thousand words, a short video might explain anything (link to youtube):

## Requirements:

For the PC client you will need these:

- Python >= 3.6 (if you have virtual env, the better) + Tk
-  vJoy (for virtual joystick if you will use that, you will find a copy on bin)
- If you use Android, any of Android clients (There's source code, or compiled APK in bin folder). 

For the input you will need any of these:
